• How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Creating functional and secure code depends on clearly conceptualizing the software requirements ahead of development, avoiding anti-patterns that are known to introduce bugs and vulnerabilities, and testing code rigorously to ensure that the attempt to implement code correctly securely has succeeded. It may also involve re-designing parts of a system during the development process, if developers discover that a different implementation is necessary or preferable.

• How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Incorporating user needs into a program requires that the developer consider not only explicit requirements but also attendant circumstance (e.g., information about the client's company, their customers, and whatever design or development they have already done regarding the needs in question). Developers must design products that meet requirements but also more broadly meet the client's needs; what this looks like in a given case depends upon the specific needs.

• How do I approach designing software?

Developers should apply expertise and research to design software systems that will function according to user needs, according to best practices of implementation and security. Somewhat analogously to test-driven development, the design should be made with failure management in mind so that during implementation developers are aware of what inputs or conditions would break functionality, particularly in any components of the system that handle sensitive information.
